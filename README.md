# Smart Home Automation System

An open-ended lab project developed as part of the 1st-semester Electronics Engineering program at **NED University** under the guidance of **Dr. Amna Shabbir**. This system is designed to simulate a smart home setup, allowing dynamic control of devices like lights, fans, cameras, and thermostats.

---

## 🔧 Features
- **Dynamic Device Control**: Turn devices ON/OFF and adjust settings.
- **Logging and Reset Functionality**: Tracks actions and allows resetting the system to default.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Input validation ensures a seamless experience.

---

## 💻 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Concepts**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
